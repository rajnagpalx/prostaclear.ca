<br>It is important to note that we continue to see an increase in fraudulent transactions over the internet.

Please keep in mind that this practice is illegal and may be punishable by imprisonment and/or fines. We reserve the right to fully investigate all claims of credit card fraud which may include asking you to sign an affidavit. In addition, if you perpetrate such fraudulent activity, your credit card may be “black listed” by your credit card company, payment processors, and/or retailers, and may be unable to be used for any internet purchases. If you are not satisfied with our Apollo Research Ltd product, simply ask for a refund under our RETURNS POLICY or call us so that we can help you resolve any issues or concerns.
<br>

<br>EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, INCLUDING THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, IN NO EVENT SHALL Apollo Research Ltd OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, INTERNS, SUPPLIERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, ATTORNEY’S FEES, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE RETURNS POLICY, THE PRODUCTS, OR YOUR OR A THIRD PARTY’S USE OR ATTEMPTED USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER Apollo Research Ltd HAS HAD NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, FEES, COSTS, OR CLAIMS. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE WEBSITE OR ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE WEBSITE, OR ANY PRODUCT OFFERED ON OR PURCHASED OVER THE WEBSITE.
<br>

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY FOR ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER Apollo Research Ltd WAS AWARE OF OR ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES OR SUCH CLAIMS.

<br>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS TO THE CONTRARY, THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY DOES NOT APPLY TO CONSUMERS IN NEW JERSEY.
<br>
<br>SECTION 13 – DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
<br>
<br>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.
<br>
<br>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF (LEAD OR OTHERWISE) OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
<br>
<br>General
<br>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a “Claim” without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, Apollo Research Ltd, or any involved third party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with Apollo Research Ltd, these Terms, the PRIVACY POLICY, or the RETURNS POLICY. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Apollo Research Ltd or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Apollo Research Ltd, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Apollo Research Ltd agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against Apollo Research Ltd. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.
<br>
<br>Required Pre-Dispute Procedures
<br>We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by Mail to Apollo Research Ltd, 160 City Road, London EC1V 2NX, UK. Apollo Research Ltd will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with Apollo Research Ltd or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.
<br>
<br>Commencing Arbitration
<br>You and Apollo Research Ltd agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.
<br>
<br>Arbitration Location
<br>If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in the UK unless Apollo Research Ltd otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.
<br>
<br>Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator
<br>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those resolved under the procedures set forth in subsection “b” above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection “c” above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.
<br>
<br>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the RETURNS POLICY, the PRIVACY POLICY, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Apollo Research Ltd.
<br>
<br>Fees
<br>For your convenience, Apollo Research Ltd will pay all of the filing costs for the arbitration, including the fees charged by the arbitrator. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.
<br>
<br>Governing Law and Award
<br>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive laws o f160 City Road, London EC1V 2NX, UK, excluding its conflict of law provisions unless in the event that Apollo Research Ltd agrees that the substantive law of the State in which you reside may be followed and applied. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>Enforceability
<br>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Apollo Research Ltd, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.
<br>
<br>Miscellaneous
<br>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Apollo Research Ltd and shall not be modified except in writing by Apollo Research Ltd.
<br>

<br>Apollo Research Ltd reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of the Website, purchase of a product on or through the Website, or use or attempted use of a Apollo Research Ltd product, is affirmation of your consent to such changes.

Your continued use of the Website, purchase of a product on or through the Website, or use or attempted use of a Apollo Research Ltd product, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.
<br>
<br>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH BINDING, FINAL, AND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION.
<br>
<br>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPT TO USE A PRODUCT PURCHASED ON OR THROUGH THIS WEBSITE (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO Apollo Research Ltd AT 128 CITY ROAD, LONDON, EC1V 2NX.
